# Pextract XML API

This work depends on the [pextract](https://github.com/marfors/paradigmextract) tool and the [DFDL schema](https://github.com/keeleleek/dfdl-pextract-schema) for converting the textual paradigm file to an appropriate XML.

It is used mainly in bootstrapping morphology resource building in the Grammatical Framework using [pextract2GF](https://github.com/keeleleek/pextract2gf).
